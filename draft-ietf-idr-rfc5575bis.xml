	<abstract>
   <t>
   This document obsoletes both RFC5575 and RFC7674.
   </t>
	<t>
   This document defines a Border Gateway Protocol Network Layer
   Reachability Information (BGP NLRI) encoding format, that can be used
   to distribute traffic Flow Specifications. This allows the routing
   system to propagate information regarding more specific components of
   the traffic aggregate defined by an IP destination prefix.
   </t>
   <t>
   It also specifies BGP Extended Community encoding formats, that can be
   used to propagate Traffic Filtering Actions along with the Flow
   Specification NLRI. Those Traffic Filtering Actions encode actions a
   routing system can take if the packet matches the Flow Specification.
   </t>
   <t>
   Additionally, it defines two applications of that encoding format:
   one that can be used to automate inter-domain coordination of traffic
   filtering, such as what is required in order to mitigate
   (distributed) denial-of-service attacks, and a second application to
   provide traffic filtering in the context of a BGP/MPLS VPN service.
   Other applications (ie. centralized control of traffic
   in a SDN or NFV context) are also possible. Other drafts specify IPv6,
   MPLS addresses, L2VPN addresses, and NV03 encapsulation of IP addresses
   as Flow Specification extensions.
   </t>
   <t>
   The information is carried via the BGP, thereby reusing protocol
   algorithms, operational experience, and administrative processes such
   as inter-provider peering agreements.
   </t>
    </abstract>
  </front>
  <middle>
    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
   <t>
   This document obsoletes both "<xref target="RFC5575" format="title" />" <xref target="RFC5575" />
       and "<xref target="RFC7674" format="title" />"<xref target="RFC7674" />.
   </t>
   <t>
	Modern IP routers contain both the capability to forward traffic
    according to IP prefixes as well as to classify, shape, rate limit,
    filter, or redirect packets based on administratively defined
    policies.
    These traffic policy mechanisms allow the operator to define match
    rules that operate on multiple fields of the packet header.  Actions
    such as the ones described above can be associated with each rule.
	</t>
	<t>
    The n-tuple consisting of the matching criteria defines an aggregate
    traffic Flow Specification. The matching criteria can include
    elements such as source and destination address prefixes, IP
    protocol, and transport protocol port numbers.
	</t>
	<t>
   <xref target="dissemination_ipv4_flowspec" /> of this document defines a general procedure to encode Flow
   Specification for aggregated traffic flows so that they can be
   distributed as a BGP <xref target="RFC4271" /> NLRI.
   Additionally, <xref target="traffic_filtering_actions" /> of this document defines the
   required Traffic Filtering Actions BGP Extended Communities
   and mechanisms to use BGP for intra- and inter-provider
   distribution of traffic filtering rules to filter (distributed)
   denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
	</t>
	<t>
	By expanding routing information with Flow Specifications, the
	routing system can take advantage of the ACL (Access Control List) or
	firewall capabilities in the router's forwarding path.  Flow
	Specifications can be seen as more specific routing entries to a
	unicast prefix and are expected to depend upon the existing unicast
	data information.
	</t>
	<t>
    A Flow Specification received from an external autonomous system will
    need to be validated against unicast routing before being accepted
    (<xref target="validation_procedure" />). The flow specification
    received from an internal BGP peer within the same autonomous system
    (per <xref target="RFC4271" />) is assumed to have been validated prior
    to transmission within the iBGP mesh of an autonomous system.
    If the aggregate traffic flow defined by the unicast destination
    prefix is forwarded to a given BGP peer, then the local system can
    install more specific Flow Specifications that may result in different
    forwarding behavior, as requested by this system.
	</t>
   <t>
   From an operational perspective, the utilization of BGP as the
   carrier for this information allows a network service provider to
   reuse both internal route distribution infrastructure (e.g., route
   reflector or confederation design) and existing external
   relationships (e.g., inter-domain BGP sessions to a customer
   network).
   </t>
   <t>
   While it is certainly possible to address this problem using other
   mechanisms, this solution has been utilized in deployments because of the
   substantial advantage of being an incremental addition to already
   deployed mechanisms.
   </t>
   <t>In current deployments, the information distributed by this
   extension is originated both manually as well as automatically. The
   latter by systems that are able to detect malicious traffic flows.  When
   automated systems are used, care should be taken to ensure their
   correctness as well as the limitations of the systems that receive and
   process the advertised Flow Specifications
   (see also <xref target="security_considerations" />).
   </t>
   <t>
   This specification defines required protocol extensions to address
   most common applications of IPv4 unicast and VPNv4 unicast filtering.
   The same mechanism can be reused and new match criteria added to
   address similar filtering needs for other BGP address families such as
   IPv6 families <xref target="I-D.ietf-idr-flow-spec-v6"></xref>.

    when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.
	</t>
	</section>
	<section title="Flow Specifications">
	<t>
	 A Flow Specification is an n-tuple consisting of several matching
	criteria that can be applied to IP traffic.  A given IP packet is
	said to match the defined Flow Specification if it matches all the specified
	criteria. This n-tuple is encoded into a BGP NLRI defined below.
	</t>
  <t>

  </t>
	<t>A given Flow Specification may be associated with a set of attributes, depending on
   the particular application; such attributes may or may not include
   reachability information (i.e., NEXT_HOP).  Well-known or AS-specific
   community attributes can be used to encode a set of predetermined
   actions.
   </t>
   <t>
     A particular application is identified by a specific (Address Family
     Identifier, Subsequent Address Family Identifier (AFI, SAFI)) pair <xref
     target="RFC4760"></xref> and corresponds to a distinct set of RIBs.  Those
     RIBs should be treated independently from each other in order to assure
     non-interference between distinct applications.
   </t>
   <t>
     BGP itself treats the NLRI as a key to an entry in its
     databases.  Entries that are placed in the Loc-RIB are then
     associated with a given set of semantics, which is application
     dependent.  This is consistent with existing BGP applications.  For
     instance, IP unicast routing (AFI=1, SAFI=1) and IP multicast
     reverse-path information (AFI=1, SAFI=2) are handled by BGP without
     any particular semantics being associated with them until installed
     in the Loc-RIB.
	</t>
	<t>
   Standard BGP policy mechanisms, such as UPDATE filtering by NLRI
   prefix as well as community matching and manipulation, must apply to the Flow Specification
   defined NLRI-type, especially in an inter-domain environment.
   Network operators can also control propagation of such
   routing updates by enabling or disabling the exchange of a particular
   (AFI, SAFI) pair on a given BGP peering session.
	</t>

	<section title="Dissemination of IPv4 FLow Specification Information" anchor="dissemination_ipv4_flowspec">
	<t>
	This document defines a Flow Specification NLRI type (<xref target="fs_nlri" />)
  that may include several components such as destination prefix,
  source prefix, protocol, ports, and others (see
  <xref target="nlri_value_encoding" /> below).
 	</t>
	<t>
	 This NLRI information is encoded using MP_REACH_NLRI and
	MP_UNREACH_NLRI attributes as defined in  <xref target="RFC4760"></xref>.
	Whenever the corresponding application does not require Next Hop
	information, this shall be encoded as a 0-octet length Next Hop in
	the MP_REACH_NLRI attribute (if a non 0-octet Next Hop is present
    it should be ignored on receipt).
	</t>
	<t>
	 The NLRI field of the MP_REACH_NLRI and MP_UNREACH_NLRI is encoded as
	a 1- or 2-octet NLRI length field followed by a variable-length NLRI
	value.  The NLRI length is expressed in octets.

   Implementations wishing to exchange Flow Specification MUST use
   BGP's Capability Advertisement facility to exchange the Multiprotocol
   Extension Capability Code (Code 1) as defined in <xref target="RFC4760"></xref>.
   The (AFI, SAFI) pair carried in the Multiprotocol Extension
   Capability MUST be (AFI=1, SAFI=133) for IPv4 Flow Specification, and
   (AFI=1, SAFI=134) for VPNv4 Flow Specification.
   </t>
	<section title="Length Encoding">
    <t>
	<list style="symbols">
	<t>If the NLRI length is smaller than 240 (0xf0 hex) octets, the length
   field can be encoded as a single octet.  </t>
    <t>Otherwise, it is encoded as
    an extended-length 2-octet value in which the most significant nibble
    of the first byte is all ones.</t>
	</list>
	</t>
	<t>
	 In <xref target="fs_nlri" /> above, values less-than 240 are encoded using two hex
	digits (0xnn).  Values above 239 are encoded using 3 hex digits
	(0xfnnn).  The highest value that can be represented with this
	encoding is 4095. For example the length value of 239 is encoded as 0xef (single octet)
    while 240 is encoded as 0xf0f0 (2-octet).

   <t>Encoding: &lt;[component]+&gt;</t>
   <t>
   A specific packet is considered to match the Flow
   Specification when it matches the intersection (AND) of all the
   components present in the Flow Specification.
  </t>
   <t>
   Components must follow strict type ordering by increasing
   numerical order. A given component type may (exactly once) or may not be
   present in the Flow Specification. If present, it MUST precede any component of
   higher numeric type value.
   </t>
   <t>
       All combinations of components within a single Flow Specification are allowed. However,
       some combinations cannot match any packets (ie. "ICMP Type AND Port" will never
       match any packets), and thus SHOULD NOT be propagated by BGP.

<section anchor="traffic_filtering" title="Traffic Filtering">
    <t>
   Traffic filtering policies have been traditionally considered to be relatively
 static.  Limitations of these static mechanisms caused this new dynamic mechanism to be
 designed for the three new applications of traffic filtering:
    <list style="symbols">
        <t>Prevention of traffic-based, denial-of-service (DOS) attacks.</t>
        <t>Traffic filtering in the context of BGP/MPLS VPN service.</t>
        <t>Centralized traffic control for SDN/NFV networks.</t>
    </list>
 These applications require coordination among service providers and/or coordination
 among the AS within a service provider.
	</t>
	<t>
	The Flow Specification NLRI defined above to convey information about traffic
filtering rules for traffic that should be discarded or handled in a manner
specified by a set of pre-defined actions (which are defined in BGP Extended
Communities). This mechanism is primarily designed to allow an upstream
autonomous system to perform inbound filtering in their ingress routers of
traffic that a given downstream AS wishes to drop.
   </t>
   <t>
   In order to achieve this goal, this draft specifies two application specific
   NLRI identifiers that provide traffic filters, and a set of actions encoding
   in BGP Extended Communities.  The two application specific NLRI identifiers
   are:
   <list style="symbols">
   <t>
     IPv4 Flow Specification identifier (AFI=1, SAFI=133) along with specific
     semantic rules for IPv4 routes, and
   </t>
   <t>
     VPNv4 Flow Specification identifier (AFI=1, SAFI=134)
     value, which can be used to propagate traffic filtering information
     in a BGP/MPLS VPN environment.
   </t>
   </list>
   </t>
   <t>
       Encoding of the NLRI is described in <xref target="dissemination_ipv4_flowspec" /> for IPv4 Flow Specification and   in
       <xref target="traffic_filtering_vpn" /> for VPNv4 Flow Specification. The filtering actions are described
       in <xref target="traffic_filtering_actions" />.
   </t>
<section title="Ordering of Flow Specifications">
<t>
   More than one Flow Specification may match a
   particular traffic flow.  Thus, it is necessary to define the order
   in which Flow Specifications get matched and actions being applied to a
   particular traffic flow.
   This ordering function is such that it does not depend on the arrival order
   of the Flow Specification via BGP and thus is consistent in the network.
</t>
<t>
   The relative order of two Flow Specifications is determined by
   comparing their respective components. The algorithm starts by
   comparing the left-most components (lowest component type value) of the
   Flow Specifications.  If the types
   differ, the Flow Specification with lowest numeric type value has higher precedence
   (and thus will match before) than the Flow Specification that doesn't contain that
   component type. If the component types are the same, then a type-
   specific comparison is performed (see below) if the types are equal the
   algorithm continues with the next component.
</t>
<t>
  For IP prefix values (IP destination or source prefix): If one of the
    two prefixes to compare is a more specific prefix of the other, the more
    specific prefix has higher precedence. Otherwise the one with the
    lowest IP value has higher precedence.
</t>
<t>
   For all other component types, unless otherwise specified, the comparison is
   performed by comparing the component data as a binary string using the
   memcmp() function as defined by <xref target="ISO_IEC_9899" />. For strings with equal
   lengths the lowest string (memcmp) has higher precedence. For strings of
   different lengths, the common prefix is compared. If the common prefix is not
   equal the string with the lowest prefix has higher precedence. If the common
   prefix is equal, the longest string is considered to have higher precedence
   than the shorter one.
</t>

<t>
  The code in <xref target="flow_rule_cmp_src" /> shows a Python3 implementation
  of the comparison algorithm. The full code was tested with Python 3.6.3 and can be
  obtained at <eref target="https://github.com/stoffi92/flowspec-cmp">https://github.com/stoffi92/flowspec-cmp</eref>.

<section title="Validation Procedure" anchor="validation_procedure">
<t>Flow Specifications received from a BGP peer that are accepted in
   the respective Adj-RIB-In are used as input to the route selection
   process.  Although the forwarding attributes of two routes for the
   same Flow Specification prefix may be the same, BGP is still required
   to perform its path selection algorithm in order to select the
   correct set of attributes to advertise.
</t>
<t>
   The first step of the BGP Route Selection procedure (Section 9.1.2 of
   <xref target="RFC4271"></xref> is to exclude from the
   selection procedure routes that are
   considered non-feasible.  In the context of IP routing information,
   this step is used to validate that the NEXT_HOP attribute of a given
   route is resolvable.
</t>
<t>
   The concept can be extended, in the case of the Flow Specification NLRI,
   to allow other validation procedures.
</t>
<t>
    The validation process described below validates Flow Specifications against
    unicast routes received over the same AFI but the associated unicast routing
    information SAFI:
<list>
    <t>Flow specification received over SAFI=133 will be validated
      against routes received over SAFI=1
	  </t>
	 <t>Flow specification received over SAFI=134 will be validated
      against routes received over SAFI=128
	 </t>
</list>
</t>
<t>
   By default a Flow Specification NLRI MUST be validated such that it is
   considered feasible if and only if all of the below is true:
<list>
<t>
  a) A destination prefix component is embedded in the Flow Specification.
</t>
<t>
  b) The originator of the Flow Specification matches the originator of
  the best-match unicast route for the destination prefix embedded
  in the Flow Specification (this is the unicast route with the longest
    possible prefix length covering the destination prefix embedded in
    the Flow Specification).
</t>
<t>
  c) There are no more specific unicast routes, when compared with the
  flow destination prefix, that have been received from a different
  neighboring AS than the best-match unicast route, which has been
  determined in rule b).
</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>
  However, rule a) MAY be relaxed by explicit configuration, permitting Flow
  Specifications that include no destination prefix component. If such
  is the case, rules b) and c) are moot and MUST be disregarded.
</t>
<t>
   By originator of a BGP route, we mean either the address of the
    originator in the ORIGINATOR_ID Attribute <xref target="RFC4456" />,
    or the source IP address of the BGP peer, if this path attribute is
    not present.
</t>
<t>
   BGP implementations MUST also enforce that the AS_PATH attribute of a
   route received via the External Border Gateway Protocol (eBGP)
   contains the neighboring AS in the left-most position of the AS_PATH
   attribute.  While this rule is optional in the BGP specification, it
   becomes necessary to enforce it for security reasons.
</t>
<t>
The best-match unicast route may change over the time independently of the
Flow Specification NLRI.  Therefore, a revalidation of the Flow Specification
NLRI MUST be performed whenever unicast routes change.  Revalidation is
defined as retesting that clause a and clause b above are true.
</t>
<t>Explanation:
</t>
<t>
   The underlying concept is that the neighboring AS that advertises the
   best unicast route for a destination is allowed to advertise Flow
   Specification information that conveys a more or equally specific destination
   prefix.  Thus, as long as there are no more specific unicast routes,
   received from a different neighboring AS, which would be affected by
   that Flow Specification.
</t>
<t>
   The neighboring AS is the immediate destination of the traffic
   described by the Flow Specification.  If it requests these flows to
   be dropped, that request can be honored without concern that it
   represents a denial of service in itself.  Supposedly, the traffic is
   being dropped by the downstream autonomous system, and there is no
   added value in carrying the traffic to it.

    Multiple Traffic Filtering Actions defined in this document may be present for a single

<section title="Interaction with other Filtering Mechanisms in Routers">
 <t>
   Implementations SHOULD provide mechanisms that map an arbitrary BGP
   community value (normal or extended) to Traffic Filtering Actions that
   require different mappings in different systems in the network.  For
   instance, providing packets with a worse-than-best-effort, per-hop
   behavior is a functionality that is likely to be implemented
   differently in different systems and for which no standard behavior
   is currently known.  Rather than attempting to define it here, this
   can be accomplished by mapping a user-defined community value to
   platform-/network-specific behavior via user configuration.
 </t>
</section>
 <section anchor="rules_action_interference" title="Considerations on Traffic Filtering Action Interference">
<t>
   Since Traffic Filtering Actions are represented as BGP extended community values,
   Traffic Filtering Actions may interfere with each other (e.g. there may be more than
   one conflicting traffic-rate-bytes Traffic Filtering Action associated with a single
   Flow Specification). Traffic Filtering Action interference has no impact on BGP propagation
   of Flow Specifications (all communities are propagated according to policies).
</t>
<t>
   If a Flow Specification associated with interfering Traffic Filtering Actions is selected for
   packet forwarding, it is an implementation decision which of the interfering
   Traffic Filtering Actions are selected. Implementors of this specification SHOULD
   document the behaviour of their implementation in such cases.
</t>
<t>
   Operators are encouraged to make use of the BGP policy framework
   supported by their implementation in order to achieve a predictable behaviour
   (ie. match - replace - delete communities on administrative boundaries). See also

<section anchor="traffic_filtering_vpn" title="Dissemination of Traffic Filtering in BGP/MPLS VPN Networks">
<t>
   Provider-based Layer 3 VPN networks, such as the ones using a BGP/ MPLS IP
   VPN <xref target="RFC4364"></xref> control plane, may have different traffic
   filtering requirements than Internet service providers. But also Internet
   service providers may use those VPNs for scenarios like having the Internet
   routing table in a VRF, resulting in the same traffic filtering requirements
   as defined for the global routing table environment within this document.
   This document defines an additional BGP NLRI type (AFI=1, SAFI=134) value,
   which can be used to propagate Flow Specification in a BGP/MPLS
   VPN environment.
 </t>
<t>
   The NLRI format for this address family consists of a fixed-length Route
   Distinguisher field (8 bytes) followed by the Flow Specification NLRI value <xref target="nlri_value_encoding" />.
   The NLRI length field shall include both the 8 bytes of the Route
   Distinguisher as well as the subsequent Flow Specification NLRI value.
   The resulting encoding is shown in <xref target="figure_fs_nlri_mpls" />.

   Propagation of this NLRI is controlled by matching Route Target
   extended communities associated with the BGP path advertisement with
   the VRF import policy, using the same mechanism as described in BGP/
   MPLS IP VPNs <xref target="RFC4364"></xref>.
</t>
<t>
   Flow Specifications received via this NLRI apply only to traffic
   that belongs to the VRF(s) in which it is imported. By default,
   traffic received from a remote PE is switched via an MPLS forwarding
   decision and is not subject to filtering.

    Such extensions SHOULD also specify a way to encode an "always-match" match condition within
    the newly introduced components (this is a match condition, encoded with the newly introduced components:

  <section title="Security Considerations" anchor="security_considerations">
   <t> As long as Flow Specifications are restricted to match the
   corresponding unicast routing paths for the relevant prefixes (<xref target="validation_procedure" />),
   the security characteristics of this proposal are equivalent to the existing security
   properties of BGP unicast routing. Any relaxation of the validation
   procedure described in <xref target="validation_procedure" /> may
   allow unwanted Flow Specifications to be propagated and thus unwanted Traffic
   Filtering Actions may be applied to flows.
    </t>
   <t>Where the above mechanisms are not in place, this could open the door
   to further denial-of-service attacks such as unwanted traffic filtering,
   remarking or redirection.
   </t>
   <t>
    One proposal for relaxing the above mechanisms within the administrative
    boundaries of an AS via iBGP is included in <xref target="I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-flowspec-oid" />.
    Deployment of such specific relaxations of the validation within an
    administrative boundary of a network, defined by an AS or an
    AS-Confederation boundary, may be useful in some networks for
    quickly distributing filters to prevent denial-of-service attacks.
    For a network to utilize this relaxation, the BGP policies must
    support additional filtering since the origin AS field is empty.
    Specifications relaxing the validation restrictions SHOULD
    contain security considerations that provide details on the
    required additional filtering.
   </t>
   <t>
       Inter-provider routing is based on a web of trust. Neighboring
   autonomous systems are trusted to advertise valid reachability
   information. If this trust model is violated, a neighboring
   autonomous system may cause a denial-of-service attack by advertising
   reachability information for a given prefix for which it does not
   provide service (unfiltered address space hijack). Since validation
   of the Flow Specification is tied to the announcement of
   the best unicast route, this may also cause this validation to fail
   and consequently prevent Flow Specifications from being accepted
   by a peer. Possible mitigations are <xref target="RFC6811" /> and
   <xref target="RFC8205" />.
   </t>
   <t> Enabling firewall-like capabilities in routers without centralized
   management could make certain failures harder to diagnose.  For
   example, it is possible to allow TCP packets to pass between a pair
   of addresses but not ICMP packets.  It is also possible to permit
   packets smaller than 900 or greater than 1000 bytes to pass between a
    pair of addresses, but not packets whose length is in the range 900-
   1000.  Such behavior may be confusing and these capabilities should
   be used with care whether manually configured or coordinated through
   the protocol extensions described in this document.
  </t>
  <t>
      Flow Specification BGP speakers (e.g. automated DDoS controllers) not properly programmed,
      algorithms that are not performing as expected, or simply rogue systems
      may announce unintended Flow Specifications, send updates at a high rate
      or generate a high number of Flow Specifications.
      This may stress the receiving systems, exceed their maximum capacity or
      may lead to unwanted Traffic Filtering Actions being applied to flows.
  </t>
    <t> While the general verification of the Flow Specification NLRI
    is specified in this document (<xref target="validation_procedure" />) the Traffic Filtering
    Actions received by a third party may need custom verification or filtering. In particular
    all non traffic-rate actions may allow a third party to modify packet forwarding properties and potentially
    gain access to other routing-tables/VPNs or undesired queues. This can be avoided by proper filtering/screening of the
    Traffic Filtering Action communities
    at network borders and only exposing a predefined subset of Traffic Filtering Actions (see <xref target="traffic_filtering_actions" />)
    to third parties. One way to achieve this is by mapping user-defined communities, that can be set by the third party, to
    Traffic Filtering Actions and not accepting Traffic Filtering Action extended communities from third parties.
    </t>
      <t>This extension adds additional information to Internet routers.
          These are limited in terms of the maximum number of data elements
          they can hold as well as the number of events they are able to
          process in a given unit of time. Service providers need to consider
          the maximum capacity of their devices and may need to limit the
          number of Flow Specifications accepted and processed.

    <section title="Comparison with RFC 5575">
      <t>
        This document includes numerous editorial changes to <xref target="RFC5575" />.
        It also completely incorporates the redirect action clarification document <xref target="RFC7674" />.
        It is recommended to read the entire document. The
        authors, however want to point out the following technical changes to
        <xref target="RFC5575" />:
        <list>
          <t>
            <xref target="intro" /> introduces the Flow Specification NLRI. In
            <xref target="RFC5575" /> this NLRI was defined as an opaque-key in BGPs database. This
            specification has removed all references to a opaque-key property.
           BGP is able to understand the NLRI encoding. This
            change also resulted in a new section regarding error-handling and
            extensibility (<xref target="errorhandling" /> and <xref target="future_extensions" />).
          </t>
          <t>
            <xref target="type_3" /> defines a numeric operator and comparison
            bit combinations. In <xref target="RFC5575" /> the meaning of those
            bit combination was not explicitly defined and left open to the
            reader.
          </t>
          <t>
            <xref target="type_3" /> - <xref target="type_8" />, <xref
            target="type_10" />, <xref target="type_11" /> make use of the above
            numeric operator. The allowed length of the comparison value was not
            consistently defined in <xref target="RFC5575" />.
          </t>
          <t>
            <xref target="traffic_filtering_actions" /> defines all Traffic
            Filtering Action Extended communities as transitive extended communities.
            <xref target="RFC5575" /> defined the traffic-rate action to be
            non-transitive and did not define the transitivity of the other
            Traffic Filtering Action communities at all.
          </t>
          <t>
            <xref target="traffic_rate_in_packets" /> introduces a new Traffic
            Filtering Action (traffic-rate-packets). This action did not exist
            in <xref target="RFC5575" />.
          </t>
          <t>
            <xref target="rt_redirect_action_subtype" /> contains the same
            redirect actions already defined in <xref target="RFC5575" />
            however, these actions have been renamed  to "rt-redirect" to make
            it clearer that the redirection is based on route-target.
            This section also completely incorporates the <xref target="RFC7674" />
            clarifications of the Flowspec Redirect Extended Community.
          </t>
          <t>
            <xref target="rules_action_interference" /> contains general
            considerations on interfering traffic actions.
            <xref target="traffic_action_subtype" /> also
            cross-references this section. <xref target="RFC5575" /> did not mention this.
          </t>
          <t>
            <xref target="errorhandling" /> contains new error handling.
          </t>
          <t>
            <xref target="future_extensions" /> describes graceful handling
              of unknown Flow Specification components to allow future extensions.
